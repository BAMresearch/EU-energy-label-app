          "explanation": "Your washing machine's eco programme may take longer, but it's lower temperature saves electric energy. Most of the electricity a washing machine uses is consumed by heating the water. Instead of using a lot of hot water, the eco programme gives the detergent more time to do its job cleaning the laundry. This can save up to 30 or even 50 % energy per cycle.",

A lot of energy can be saved by using the heat still stored in the electric plate of the cooktop if you have one with older metal  plates.
